<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
    We are dedicated to building a community of technical women and their allies at 
    the University of Rhode Island and beyond. We offer a network of support and 
    encouragement for all women pursuing careers in Computer Science and in related 
    fields. We aim to provide service opportunities, cultivate professional 
    development, initiate a connection between peers, and foster innovation to create 
    future leaders in technology. We strive to promote awareness of gender issues and 
    create opportunities to achieve equality and establish a climate for discussion. 
    It is our hope to enlist all genders and disciplines to help us achieve our goals.
