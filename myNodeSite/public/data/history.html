<h3>History of SWiC</h3>
<p>
    The Society for Women in Computing was founded in September of 2018.
     Senior, Alli Cheney, began investigating similar clubs at other universities 
     and made the decision to bring the Society for Women in Computing to URI. 
     Along the way, she found her Vice President, Lauren Black, and together they 
     strived to make all their meetings revolve around four themes: professional 
     development, empowerment, service, and innovation.

    In September 2019, Lily Sisouvong picked up where Alli left off, hoping to 
    continue the hard work that Alli and Lauren put into creating SWIC, and continued 
    to make all the meetings revolve around our four original themes as well as a fifth, 
    community and support. The same happened in 2020 as Victoria Ryan took over as 
    President for both our 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 years. They implemented meetings that 
    allowed time for members to bond and become a community. With the help of their executive
     boards, they looked forward to accomplishing these goals.

    Now, in September 2024, our SWiC E-Board is more determined than ever to continue SWiCâ€™s 
    legacy and provide a space for women and their allies to thrive in the computing community. 
    Riley Maguire now serves as our President, with Ndoumbe Ndoye as Vice President, Ayishat 
    Oguntade as Treasurer, and Sudishma Acharya as Secretary.
